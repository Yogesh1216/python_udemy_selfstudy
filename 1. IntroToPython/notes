types of Programming language - low level language | high level language

high level language -
- compiler based - C , C++
  interpreter based -php , js
  hybrid - python , java , c#

Compiler -    .c -> machine code (.exe)
         1) takes a program file and generated new program file.
         2) if there are no errors than only translaction is done in machine code.
         3) translaction is done only once
interpreter -
         1) it converts code to machine code line by line and executes it.
         2) no new file is created.
         3) everytime translactioin is done.
hybrid -
program.py ->(compiler-check for errors) program.pyc (hidden file)(bytecode) -> (interpreter) machine code.
1) bytecode is converted to machine code using (pvm) python virtual machine.
2) python is platform independent as every OS has its own pvm.
--compiler based language are faster than interpreter language.

- styles of programming:
  functional/procedural programming
  oops - classes and objects
  modular programming - contain classes and functions.

- features of python:
    simple , easy to learn , open source , platform independent , huge library

- areas of programming:
AI , data science , machine learning , mobile apps , web programming , etc.
